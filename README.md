# React Native Intermittent Crash on API Fetch

This repository demonstrates a common but difficult-to-debug issue in React Native: an intermittent crash during an API fetch that doesn't provide clear error messages.  The app fetches data from a remote API.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it crashes silently.

## Problem

The core problem is that the `fetch` promise might reject without proper error handling in the `catch` block. In this scenario, the React Native environment might not propagate the error to the app in a user-friendly way, resulting in a silent crash.

## Solution

The solution involves robust error handling within the `try...catch` block.  This includes logging the error for debugging purposes, displaying a user-friendly message to the user and ensuring that the `finally` block always runs to update the loading state.
